<p>  You use the web everyday, but do you understand how Web pages are created? Web pages 
are created using special language called HTML5. Luckily, learning
the language is pretty simple and you only need to learn a few stps to get started.</p>

<ul>  
<li> A text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, TextWrangler are a few options)</li>
<li> A browser (Safari, Chrome, Opera, and Firefox all work here)</li>
<li> Some pictures to decorate your page</li>
</ul>

<p> Creating a Web page can be tricky, because one mistake can crash a page.  Just look at
 it as a challenge, make small changes, and test your page often.</p>
